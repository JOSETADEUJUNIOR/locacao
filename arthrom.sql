O LCP foi ressecado e a patela foi substituída em todos os casos. Posteriormente, foram aplicados 2 testes (OKS e KSS) no pré-operatório de aos 3 meses, 6 meses, e acompanhamento de 1 ano. Também usaram ??para avaliação, melhorias clínicas precoces. O exame radiológico pós-operatório foi revisado em busca de linhas radio lúcidas ou soltura dos componentes. Todos os pacientes seguiram um protocolo padrão pós-operatório idêntico de reabilitação incluindo suporte de peso conforme tolerado com muletas no 1º dia de pós-operatório.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resultados:</strong>&nbsp;A melhora média no OKS foi de 19,5 para 41,2, enquanto o KSS melhorou com uma pontuação média de 64,7 no pré-operatório para 167,5 na avaliação final, apresentando resultados de bons a excelentes em 95% dos joelhos tratados. Avaliando a amplitude de movimento, a média máxima do movimento ativo foi de 124° e nenhum dos pacientes necessitou de cirurgia de revisão ou manipulação sob anestesia. Nenhuma complicação foi observada na avaliação final como soltura séptica ou asséptica ou lesão vascular ou neurológica.</p></li></ul><p><br /><strong>Estudo 2:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Objetivo do estudo:</strong>&nbsp;avaliar a satisfação subjetiva do paciente e os resultados clínicos e radiológicos em dois grupos de pacientes submetidos a ATJ primária usando polis MC e PS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Método</strong>: 100 pacientes foram submetidos a ATJ devido à osteoartrite do joelho e divididos em 2 grupos. O grupo A foi composto por 50 pacientes que utilizaram liners PS, enquanto o grupo B também foi composto por 50 pacientes que usaram o liner medialmente congruentes (MC). A técnica cirúrgica foi idêntica: equilíbrio do gap em extensão e ressecção medida em flexão; os ligamentos cruzados sempre foram removidos; o alinhamento coronal seguiu o eixo mecânico e a inclinação tibial foi fixada em 3° no grupo PS e 5° no MC. Os testes OKS e KSS foram avaliados no pré-operatório e após acompanhamento mínimo de 2 anos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resultados:</strong>&nbsp;não houve diferenças estatísticas pré-operatórias entre os dois grupos na ADM pré-operatória média (PS 112°, MC 108°), KSS pré-operatório médio (PS 64,4, MC 63,7), OKS pré-operatório médio (PS 19,6; MC 19,0). No acompanhamento final, não houve diferenças estatísticas entre os dois grupos no OKS médio (PS 40,5; MC 41,1) e no KSS médio (OS 161,5, MC 165,7). Encontramos uma diferença estatisticamente, mas não clinicamente significativa, na ADM final: a média máxima a flexão ativa foi de 120° no grupo PS e 123° no grupo MC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conclusão</strong>: Este estudo avaliou dois liners de polietileno biomecanicamente diferentes, mostrando que reduzir o nível de conformidade intra-articular teve efeitos mínimos nos relatos dos pacientes e nos resultados clínicos objetivos de curto prazo, mas um efeito potencialmente benéfico na amplitude de movimento (ADM). Este estudo sugere que, uma vez obtida uma estabilidade intraoperatória satisfatória, o nível mínimo de restrição deve ser usado.</p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Link para acessar aos artigos na íntegra e catálogos:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rQDK2r4N7u5bi1KZyyUiPIoHDe0MrTlN?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rQDK2r4N7u5bi1KZyyUiPIoHDe0MrTlN?usp=sharing</a></p><p> </p><p> </p>', 1, 2, '2024-06-18 16:34:15', NULL, '2024-06-18 16:42:23', 'studos-feitos-em-2019-com-o-iner--edial-ongruent-da-ersona', 'studos-feitos-em-2019-com-o-iner-edial-ongruent-da-ersona.jpg', NULL, 1, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, NULL, NULL),

Nesse ano constatamos um valor ainda mais assustador de recursos contingenciados por planos de saúde e hospitais, que chegou a&nbsp;R$ 2,1 bilhões.</p><p> </p><p>As distorções praticadas representam 23,1% do faturamento das distribuidoras e importadoras de produtos para a saúde, sendo que as retenções de faturamento são 12%, a inadimplência ou calote é de 9,5% e as glosas, 1,6% do faturamento.</p><p> </p><p>A retenção de faturamento é quando a fonte pagadora, após a realização de uma cirurgia previamente autorizada, não permite o faturamento dos produtos consumidos, postergando assim o pagamento. Corroborando uma percepção do mercado de que a distorção piorou nos últimos 12 meses, os números da pesquisa da ABRAIDI&nbsp;revelam que o volume pendente de faturamento atingiu a insustentável marca de R$ 1,085 bilhão, um aumento de quase 50% em relação ao ano passado. Além de ser uma prática antiética e comercialmente questionável, trata-se também de uma iniciativa abusiva por parte das fontes pagadoras. A legislação brasileira dispõe que todo consumo de produto seja faturado dentro do mês correspondente ao seu uso. O tempo médio para o recebimento a partir do dia que foi realizada a cirurgia é de 116 dias.</p><p> </p><p>O levantamento revelou também que a ampla maioria das empresas associadas à ABRAIDI sofre com glosas injustificadas, cerca de 80%, porcentagem muito parecida com a constatada no trabalho anterior. Muito embora a frequência tenha permanecido a mesma, o volume de recursos glosados representou um aumento de 24,3% em relação à 2022 e atingiu o valor nominal de R$ 145 milhões. Além disso, é importante destacar a alta ocorrência de indeferimento de pagamento em procedimentos eletivos previamente autorizados pelas operadoras ou hospitais. A pesquisa demonstrou que cerca de 40% dos procedimentos em que houve a prática de glosa referem-se a cirurgias autorizadas com antecedência.</p><p>Já a inadimplência atingiu R$ 864 milhões, maior índice da série histórica e cerca de 40% superior ao valor do ano anterior que foi de R$ 610 milhões.</p><p> </p><p>O crescimento exponencial das distorções no setor da saúde vai ao encontro de uma série de medidas adotadas pelas fontes pagadoras, relacionadas a modelos de negócios e remuneração. Percebe-se no mercado uma intensificação da verticalização, onde a operadora detém a própria rede de prestadores de serviços, como hospitais, ficando a cargo de cada unidade a compra de produtos. É imperioso destacar o aumento de novos modelos de remuneração, principalmente, a adoção do pagamento por pacote, que tem como objetivo aumentar a previsibilidade dos custos relacionados ao procedimento. Se, no início desse processo, os planos de saúde negociavam diretamente com fornecedores na tentativa de reduzir custos, com o tempo delegaram essa responsabilidade para os hospitais, fossem da rede própria ou não. Isso fez com que as negociações de preços, prazos, bem como os pagamentos fossem efetuados por esses prestadores, agravando a retenção do faturamento, distorção com maior volume financeiro contingenciado.</p><p> </p><p>Os distribuidores e importadores são as menores empresas, em relação ao faturamento do ecossistema de saúde no Brasil, mas acabam financiando as gigantes, como planos e hospitais. A questão é que ‘bancamos’ de forma impositiva e, na maioria das vezes, com práticas comerciais antiéticas que excluem aqueles que não aceitam as ‘regras’ impostas. A deterioração, ano após ano, como constatado em nossas pesquisas, revela que algo precisa ser feito urgentemente para acabar com essas práticas.</p><p> </p><p>Fonte:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saudebusiness.com/industria/distorcoes-na-saude-precisam-acabar\">https://www.saudebusiness.com/industria/distorcoes-na-saude-precisam-acabar</a></p><p> </p>', 1, 0, '2024-06-18 16:39:42', NULL, NULL, 'co--u--', 'co-u.jpg', NULL, 1, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, NULL, NULL);

Hoje, muitos pacientes têm a capacidade e o desejo de retomar as atividades de alta flexão após a TKA. O design de um implante de joelho deve aumentar, não inibir, essas oportunidades. Embora uma flexão elevada seja possível com implantes de retenção de cruzamento tradicionais, seu design pode não ser otimizado para uma flexão segura que exceda 120º. O Joelho NexGen® CR foi projetado para acomodar flexão até 155º para pacientes com habilidade e desejo para fazê-lo, mantendo a função cinemática que permite a reversão natural em uma prótese de joelho de retenção de cruzamento.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AS DEMANDAS ESPECÍFICAS DO CIRURGIÃO CR</strong></p><p>Especificamente projetado para o cirurgião CR, a Prótese Total de Joelho NexGen® CR é uma boa escolha para todos os pacientes CR porque oferece n ovos e lementos de design que abordam não apenas flexões elevadas, mas todas as questões importantes enfrentadas pelos cirurgiões CR. Considere o joelho apertado em flexão e aceitável em e xtensão. O CR oferece componentes femorais de tamanho negativo que são 2mm menores na dimensão A/P.

A Prótese Total de Joelho NexGen® LPS pode ser usada com aumentos e extensões da haste. Muitas atividades da vida diária exigem flexão acima de 120°. Considere subir escadas (75°-140°), sentar-se em uma cadeira e levantar-se novamente (90°-130°), ou agachar (130°-150°). A Prótese Total de Joelho NexGen® LPS estende a solução para pacientes com capacidade de até 155° de flexão ativa. Côndilos posteriores estendidos no componente femoral facilitam o contato tíbio-femoral para suportar a alta flexão segura de 155°. A conformação da geometria do Componente Femoral Fixo do LPS com a sua superfície de articulação permite uma perda mínima de área de contato durante a alta flexão. O recorte patelar anterior profundo na superfície articular tibial ajuda a reduzir a tensão na patela e fornece mais folga para o mecanismo de extensão. Um mecanismo modificado de coluna estabilizado posterior aumenta a resistência a subluxação em ângulos de alta flexão.

Como os côndilos femorais se mantêm centrados na tíbia durante a amplitude do movimento e o formato do sulco rotuliano é semelhante ao desenho do sistema NexGen, o percurso da rótula é semelhante a uma prótese de joelho primário. Nos procedimentos de artroplastia mais complicados, é possível utilizar a prótese NexGen Hinger em combinação com os Cones tibiais e femorais Metal Tântalo® Trabecular que abordam os casos mais difíceis de perda óssea. Devido ao joelho NexGen Hinger ter desenho modular utilizando os aumentos NexGen, os cortes ósseos básicos são idênticos aos efetuados para os componentes do sistema primário, isto ajuda a minimizar a perda óssea e permite a utilização da mesma instrumentação em procedimentos de implantes primários.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FUNÇÃO DA DOBRADIÇA COM DESIGN INOVADOR</strong></p><p>A prótese NexGen Hinger foi projetada para abordar os principais problemas que se relacionam com muitos projetos convencionais de joelho giratório.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CENTRO E ROTAÇÃO</strong></p><p>A localização central do mecanismo da dobradiça do joelho NexGen Hinger está mais próxima do eixo do componente tibial, resultando numa cinemática fêmur-tibial mais natural e estável em comparação com os desenhos anteriores de joelho de dobradiça. A rotação da plataforma do joelho NexGen Hinger foi concebida para deslocar as cargas de torção das interfaces de cimento para os tecidos moles, já que permite até25º de movimento em rotação interna e externa.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MODULARIDADE DO MECANISMO DE PINO/BLOQUEIO DA DOBRADIÇA</strong></p><p>A modularidade do pino de extensão da dobradiça permite que a implantação prossiga sem necessitar que o joelho seja demasiado manipulado enquanto os componentes são montados. Os componentes femorais e tibiais do joelho NexGen Hinger são colocados na sua posição com cimento e, com um desvio mínimo, a superfície articular tibial roda até à sua posição. A extensão da dobradiça é facilmente inserida no prato tibial e apertada.</p><p> </p><p><strong>95% DE CARGA CONDILAR</strong></p><p>Em muitos desenhos de joelho de dobradiça rotativos convencionais, a dobradiça suporta a maioria da carga compressiva até ser atingida a extensão total. Os desenhos cujo centro de rotação está situado posteriormente podem causar um efeito de alavanca na articulação, o que se traduz em tensão exercida sobre as interfaces de cimento ou um desgaste acelerado do suporte de polietileno na dobradiça. O joelho NexGen Hinger aborda estas questões, já que o componente femoral Hinger e as superfícies articulares são concebidos para manter um contato centralizado durante a amplitude de movimentos (de -3° de hiper extensão até 120°). O desenho patenteado da dobradiça permite passar 95% da carga através dos côndilos tibiais.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PRINCIPAIS CONCEITOS E VANTAGENSCINEMÁTICA FÊMUR-RÓTULA</strong></p><p>O componente femoral de joelho NexGen Hinger tem o mesmo desenho femoro-rotuliano do que outros componentes femorais NexGen. O sulco permite que a rótula faça um percurso profundo, tal como uma rótula anatômica. A rótula está totalmente suportada nas flexões até 60°. A localização central do eixo da dobradiça mantém os côndilos femorais num plano sagital estável. Isto permite um percurso da rótula mais normal, pois a rótula não se desloca posteriormente durante a flexão.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CONCEBIDO PARA LIMITAR O IMPACTO E RESISTIRÀ LUXAÇÃO</strong></p><p>• Para resistir à luxação, o desenho do mecanismo de bloqueio do Joelho NexGen Hinger oferece uma “altura de salto” de 40 mm.</p><p>• A relação de conformidade entre os côndilos femorais e a superfície articular tibial altamente côncava é praticamente de 1 para 1. Maximizando a área de contato, as tensões no polietileno são distribuídas por uma superfície maior.</p><p>• O contato ocorre no raio frontal do componente femoral de joelho NexGen Hinger com a superfície articular mesmo quando os implantes e move para a hiperextensão.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><p>Why do we use it?</p><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p> </p><p>Where does it come from?</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
